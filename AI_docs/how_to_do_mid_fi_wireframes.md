commands: produce a MID-FI wireframe (between high-fi and ultra-low-fi) 0) goal

Start from the section boxes you already have and reveal the first level of structure inside each box (true sizes and positions).

No branding or real data. Only short, role-based placeholder text.

1. global visual rules

Palette: grayscale only — #111, #666, #999, #CCC, #EEE, #FFF.

Strokes: 1–2px. Corners: ≤ 4px. No shadows, gradients, blurs, or color states.

Spacing: 8px scale only (8/16/24/32/48/64).

Typography: system font; four sizes only: H1 24, H2 18, Body 14, Caption 12 (px). Bold vs regular only; default line height.

Placeholders: images = light gray box with “[IMAGE]”; icons = 16×16 gray square “[ICON]”.

2. text/content rules

Use generic labels only: “Section title”, “Nav item”, “Item title”, “Meta line”, “Body text”, “Price”, “Status text”, “Button”, “Label”.

No real names, prices, dates, quantities, or marketing copy.

For paragraphs, use 1–2 lines of lorem only where length matters.

States appear as plain text or bracketed notes (e.g., Overdue or [overdue])—never via color or emphasis.

3. section-to-mid-fi conversion

For each section box, replace the single big rectangle with the minimal internal anatomy below. Do not add variants or polish.

A) Navigation bar

Left: [LOGO] (80×24 gray box).

Center/Right: 3–5 “Nav item” links (plain text).

Optional: one outline button labeled “Button”.

If there’s a bottom tab bar (mobile), show 3 tabs labeled “Home / Catalogue / Profile” as plain text with a thin top divider.

B) Reminder/utility bar

Single band with: [ICON] + “Reminder text” + outline “Button”. No colors.

C) Hero

Stack: H1 “Section title”, one Body line, and 1–2 outline buttons (“Primary”, “Secondary”).

If the high-fi had background media, keep a single [IMAGE] box behind/above—no art-direction.

D) Filters / search

One text field (label: “Search”).

Up to 3 simplified filter controls:

Checkbox row: [] Option (text only), or

A single Select outlined field labeled “Filter”.

Optional “Apply filters” outline button.

Do not render chips, tags, multi-select pills, or fancy dropdown menus.

E) Results grid / catalogue

Show 2–3 exemplar cards (not the full grid). Each card contains, top to bottom:

[IMAGE] (fixed ratio box)

Title (“Item title”)

Meta line (“Meta text”) and Price (“Price”) on the next line

One outline button (“Button”)

Pagination/sort appears as text links (“Prev · 1 · 2 · Next”, “Sort”)—no chevrons or pills.

F) Current rentals / lists

Show 2 list items. Each row contains:

Left: small [IMAGE]

Middle: Title + Status text (“Due text” / “Overdue”)

Right: 1–2 outline buttons (“Action”, “Secondary”)

If an item was tinted/outlined in high-fi (e.g., overdue), do not use color—just the status text.

G) Personal info / profile fields

Use a simple key–value stack:

“Field label” on one line (bold)

“Field value” as placeholder text

Trailing small outline button “Edit”

Show 3–4 fields max as exemplars.

H) Payment method

Card block: [ICON] + “Card brand” + “•••• 0000” + “Expires MM/YY”.

Right: outline buttons “Edit”, “Remove”. No badges, no color.

I) Notification settings

Each row:

Left: H2 “Setting title”; next line Caption “Description lorem”.

Right: checkbox [] plus text “On/Off”. (No toggle switch UI.)

For timing: a single Select outlined field labeled “Timing”.

J) Footer

Three simple columns each titled “Column title” with 2–3 “Link text” items. No social icons (use [ICON] if needed).

K) Modal/Drawer (only if visible)

A plain box with header “Modal title”, body with 1–2 lines of lorem, and one “Primary” outline button.

4. interaction & states (annotate only)

Add small bracket notes where behavior matters, e.g., [hover], [focus], [error], [disabled], [loading].

Do not animate, color, or style state changes.

5. layout & responsive rules

Keep the same grid and breakpoints as the high-fi.

Preserve section footprints from the ultra-low-fi (heights can be approximate but believable).

On mobile, stack in the same reading order. Reduce card count to 1 exemplar in a single column.

6. page-specific quick maps (for your three screens)
   Dashboard

Reminder bar, then H1 “Dashboard”.

Current rentals: 2 exemplar rows as per §F.

CTA band: a centered outline button labeled “Rent a tool”.

Sustainability / info card: [ICON] + two lines of lorem (no numbers).

Recommendations: 2 exemplar cards as per §E.

Catalogue

H1 “Catalogue”.

Search + filters as per §D.

Sort & filters controls simplified to text links and one select.

Results grid: 2–3 exemplar cards as per §E; simple text pagination.

Profile

H1 “Profile”.

Current rentals: 2 exemplar rows (§F).

Rental history: one combined section box with a note List appears here or show 1 row sample.

Personal info: 3–4 fields (§G).

Payment method: one block (§H).

Notification settings: 2–3 rows (§I).

7. do / don’t summary

✅ Show first-level anatomy inside each section at true scale.

✅ Use generic labels; 1–2 lorem lines only where needed.

✅ One button style (outline), one input style (outline), one select style (outline).

❌ No real data (names, prices, dates, counts, CO₂ figures).

❌ No color coding for states (overdue/available).

❌ No chips, badges, shadows, gradients, or icon set selection.

8. acceptance checklist (pass all)

Every section from ultra-low-fi is present and broken into core sub-parts.

All copy is generic/placeholder; no real values remain.

Exactly one primitive style for buttons/inputs/selects; no visual variants.

Icons and images are placeholders only.

States are annotated, not styled.

Spacing uses the 8px scale; strokes 1–2px; corners ≤4px.

Desktop + mobile layouts match the high-fi grid and breakpoints.
