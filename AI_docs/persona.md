Age:	38	|	Location:	Hillerød	|	Works	as	a	school	teacher	| Married,	two	kids	
Bio:	Brian	loves	tackling	home	improvement	projects	on	weekends,	from	building	garden	sheds	to	fixing	up	
furniture.	He	often	rents	tools	from	FOG	to	avoid	buying	expensive	equipment	he	rarely	uses.	However,	he	
finds	it	frustrating	when	he	arrives	at	the	store	only	to	discover	the	tool	he	needs	is	unavailable	or	when	rental	
terms	are	unclear.	
Motivation:	
• Wants to plan his projects in advance and secure the right tools. 
• Wants clear information about tool specifications and usage. 
• Wants a simple, fast booking and pick-up process. 
Pains:		
• Uncertainty	about	tool	availability.	
• Rental	process	feels	time-consuming	with	too	much	paperwork.	
• Limited	guidance	on	tool	usage	and	safety	precautions.	
User	Stories:	
• As	a	weekend	renovator,	I	want	to	see	real-time	availability	of	tools,	so	I	can	plan	my	project	without	
delays.	
• As	a	customer,	I	want	to	book	and	pay	online,	so	I	can	save	time	in-store.	
• As	a	DIY	enthusiast,	I	want	to	access	quick	video	guides,	so	I	can	use	tools	safely	and	effectively.	
• As	a	planner,	I	want	to	receive	reminders	before	my	rental	ends,	so	I	avoid	late	fees.
