- FOG hardware rental app
- frustrations
	- lack of information about available tools
	- unclear pricing and terms
	- no digital booking options
	- uncertainty about item availability
- task: design an app to improve the experience
- required features: 
	- browsing available equipment
	- equipment descriptions and photos
	- real-time availability status
	- online booking and payment
	- personalized recommendations
	- filters by category or skill level
	- maintenance and safety instructions
	- sustainability tracking 
	- customer reviews
- how do i imagine it:
	- something like an eshop just for renting
	- have a catalogue as on an eshop
	- have a detail page as on an eshop
	- on detail there would be the information about that tool and availability status
	- customers should be able to create a profile
	- if a customer doesn't have a profile then they should provide contact information (and if they don't return the equipment fines will be automatically taken from the account)
	- pages:
		- list of equipment (with filters for available and unavailable - should say when they will become available)
		- profile page with customizable information
		- detail page with specific equipment information (on usage and specification, photos, description, video guides)
		- checkout flow - group of pages (no cart just checkout for each equipment)
		- home page - current rentals, recommendations, start new booking
		- guides and instructions page / rental terms
		- login/register page
		- error pages
		- sustainability and transparency page - shows the enviro impact of sharing
		- ???? maybe a pick up screen as on **too good to go** ????
	- when a mobile app it should have notifications (reminders of rental end) if a web-based system then email reminders

## Empathy map

### 🧩 Empathy Map: Brian Bæk

####  **Says** (direct quotes he might say aloud)

- _“I hope they actually have the drill in stock when I get there.”_
- _“Why can’t I just book and pay online instead of filling out all this paperwork?”_
- _“I don’t want to buy a tool I’ll only use once.”_
- _“I need clear instructions so I don’t mess this up.”_
- _“Late fees are so annoying—I wish I got a reminder.”_

#### **Thinks** (internal thoughts, not always spoken)

- _“If the tool isn’t available, my whole weekend project is ruined.”_
- _“Am I getting the right tool for this job? Maybe I should double-check specs.”_
- _“The rental process is so annoying.”_
- _“I don’t want to feel stupid asking for help in the store.”_
- _“If I damage the tool, what will it cost me?”_

#### **Feels** (emotional drivers)

- Frustrated when availability is uncertain.
- Anxious about using unfamiliar equipment safely.
- Proud when a project turns out well.
- Annoyed by extra time spent on paperwork.

#### **Does** (behaviors & actions)

- Compares buying vs. renting, but usually rents.
- Reads or watches DIY tutorials online.
- Plans weekend projects in advance.
- Picks up tools at the store, often waits in line, and sometimes discovers the tool is unavailable — forcing him to waste time going to a different store.
- Usually returns tools right at the deadline, but occasionally misses it.

## User interview (Via a questionnaire)
### 📝 Introduction (for Google Form intro text)

_Hello, and thank you for helping me with my UX research project. I’m exploring how people rent equipment (like drills, saws, or garden machines) and what challenges they face with the process today. Your answers will help me understand the current experience, identify frustrations, and explore what a digital solution could improve. The survey takes about 3 minutes. All responses are anonymous and only used for this school project._

### 5 Key Open-ended Questions

1. Can you describe the last time you rented equipment — what went well and what didn’t?
2. What is the most frustrating part of renting equipment for you?
3. How do you usually check if the tool you need is available?
4. If you could change one thing about the rental process, what would it be?
5. Imagine there was an app or website for renting equipment — what features would be most valuable to you?

## UX sustainability canvas

### 🌱 Sustainable UX Canvas – FOG Equipment Rental App

#### **E – Environmental Sustainability**

**Visible Design (UI)**

- Dark mode by default → reduces energy use on OLED devices.
- Lightweight visuals → use images over video where possible; avoid autoplay.
- Clear CO₂ impact nudges → “Renting saves X kg CO₂ compared to buying.”
- Show sustainability tips in context (e.g., “Return on time = reduces need for extra production”).

**Invisible Design (Technical)**

- Green hosting provider for app infrastructure.
- Minified & optimized code to reduce load and energy waste.
- Lazy loading for photos/videos of tools.
- Caching & local storage for frequently viewed items (catalogue).
- Optimized image formats (WebP, SVG).

---

#### **S – Social Sustainability**

**Accessibility & Inclusion**

- WCAG-compliant: high contrast, alt text, semantic HTML.
- Multi-language support for Denmark’s diverse population.
- Works on older/low-performance devices (Brian might be on budget phones).

**Ethical UX & Behavior**

- Avoid dark patterns in booking (no hidden fees).
- Clear, upfront pricing and rental terms.
- Responsible nudges → return reminders (no guilt, just helpful).

**Equity & Representation**

- Gender-neutral language in onboarding/profile.
- Diverse imagery in promotional visuals (not just “handy men”).
- Consider inclusive instructions (visual + text + video guides).

**Digital Balance**

- Limit notifications to essentials (reminders, confirmations).
- No infinite scrolling catalogue — structured browsing instead.

---

#### **G – Governance (Ethics & Strategy)**

- **Strategic Anchoring:** Sustainability (tool sharing > buying) positioned as a core business value.
- **Ethical Guidelines:** Internal design principle → “No hidden costs, no manipulative upselling.”
- **Authority for Designers:** UX team empowered to choose greener defaults (dark mode, caching, sustainable nudges).
- **Measurement:** Regularly test app with Ecograder / Website Carbon to monitor footprint.
- **Transparency:** Communicate sustainability metrics to users (paperless receipts, CO₂ savings, shared tool lifespan).
