i want dark theme with every component
i want to make it look like this website's style but in dark mode: https://www.johannesfog.dk/
I would like you to take my commands or asks and look at them from a holystic view - how does this fit into the style of the site? how is the contrast on text and so on? is this component in line with the style of the https://www.johannesfog.dk/ website? does this icon make sense to put in here? follow the best UI/UX practices.
